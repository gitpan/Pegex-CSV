NAME
    Pegex::CSV - Pegex CSV Parser/Loader

SYNOPSIS
        use Pegex::CSV;

        my $list_of_lists = Pegex::CSV->new->load($csv);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a reasonable CSV parser written in Pegex.

    The first draft was written at the Amsterdam.pm meeting on 9 Oct 2014,
    in 5 minutes or so during a live demo.

    It was adapted for CPAN and made more complete on a train ride to Berlin
    the next day.

    The rather simple/elegant grammar can be found in "share/csv.pgx".
